# Brewdog API App

This is a React App which pulls data from the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/). Beers are displayed on cards and can be filtered using a search box or by selecting a filter.

## Functionality

- Initially, all beers are rendered. The user can then search by name or add one of the three filters (ABV, classic range and acidic beers).
- Only one filter can be applied at a time so a reset button on the navbar allows filters to be removed.

## Further work

- I would like to enable multiple filters to be applied at once and the use of a search term with filters.
